/**
 * @brief Minimum Cycle Ratio Solver
 *
 * The minimum cycle ratio (MCR) problem is a fundamental problem in the
 * analysis of directed graphs. Given a directed graph, the MCR problem seeks to
 * find the cycle with the minimum ratio of the sum of edge weights to the
 * number of edges in the cycle. In other words, the MCR problem seeks to find
 * the "tightest" cycle in the graph, where the tightness of a cycle is measured
 * by the ratio of the total weight of the cycle to its length.
 *
 * The MCR problem has many applications in the analysis of discrete event
 * systems, such as digital circuits and communication networks. It is closely
 * related to other problems in graph theory, such as the shortest path problem
 * and the maximum flow problem. Efficient algorithms for solving the MCR
 * problem are therefore of great practical importance.
